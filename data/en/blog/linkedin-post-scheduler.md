summary: Free Unlimited Posts Scheduler
---

LinkedIn **doesn’t allow** users to** schedule posts** on their platform. A lot of websites provide this service but you have to pay to use it. I don’t like to pay 5$ for a service that I use only twice a month. So I created a **free tool** to **help me **and I’m hoping that it will also **help you**!

This project is **open-source**, so feel free to contribute, open issues, or give feedback!

## Let me introduce you to Feed My Flow:

[**Feed My Flow**](https://feedmyflow.web.app/) allow you to **schedule post** using an easy web application. For now, the website is available only in **English **and in **French **and the application is **mobile friendly**.

On the left side, you have a calendar of your posts. On the other side, you have a sum-up of upcoming posts.

You can **choose when you want** to post your content. Content is posted **every 15 minutes**. You can choose who can see your post: only your connections or everybody. You can also **add links** to illustrate your content and choose its title.

At the same time, when you create your new post, you have a **live preview** of the result on LinkedIn. As you will see the result on LinkedIn is shown as expected!
