## What is Mailtrack.io?

Mailtrack.io is a very cheap, easy, and powerful application to track your emails. The free version allows you to see the number of times a person has opened your email but also to receive notifications each time. Moreover, if the email has a lot of interactions and is forwarded, Mailtrack notifies you.

Mailtrack integrates easily with Gmail, and it is straightforward to view the status of each new email. This is a perfect tool to follow your interactions and also to understand their impact. Personally, I use this technology to track my project emails, but also to see the impact of my prospecting. The only issue with the free tier is that it adds a signature at the end of your emails.

## How to deal with the signature?

Personally, I find it really undesirable to have this signature at the end of my emails. There are several reasons why I would like to remove it:

▹ I don’t want others to know that I’m the activity of their emails.

▹ The result makes the email look less professional.

To solve this problem, I have made the best use of the skills I have perfected:
> The art of coding.

This allows automatic deletion of the signature from messages and avoids having to do it by hand, which can take several seconds. In addition, it gives you the confidence to send emails without even worrying whether you have removed it or not.
> Automation is the key!

Here’s a small example of how this changes your life:
